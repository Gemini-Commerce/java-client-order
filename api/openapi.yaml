            Number of micro (10^-6) units of the amount.
            The value must be between -999,999 and +999,999 inclusive.
            If `units` is positive, `micros` must be positive or zero.

    orderPostalAddress:
      description: |-
        Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses.
        Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O.
        Box or similar.
        It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns,
        mountains).

        In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing
        existing data, depending on the type of process.

        Advice on address input / editing:
         - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as
           https://github.com/google/libaddressinput)
        - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of
          fields outside countries where that field is used.

            for details. Example: "CH" for Switzerland.
          type: string
        languageCode:
          description: |-
            Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if
            known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected
            to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their
            transliterated equivalents.
            This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical
            to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or
            other non-formatting related operations.

            If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a
            possibly incorrect default).

            Examples: "zh-Hant", "ja", "ja-Latn", "en".
          type: string
        postalCode:
          description: |-
            Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require
            postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger
            additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip
            validation in the U.S.A.).
          type: string
        sortingCode:
          description: |-
            Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used
            in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like
            "CEDEX", optionally followed by a number (e.g. "CEDEX 7"), or just a number
            alone, representing the "sector code" (Jamaica), "delivery area indicator"
            (Malawi) or "post office indicator" (e.g. Côte d'Ivoire).
          type: string
        administrativeArea:
          description: |-
            Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal
            addresses of a country or region.
            For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture.
            Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous
            community (e.g. "Barcelona" and not "Catalonia").
            Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g.
            in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
          type: string
        locality:
          description: |-
            Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address.
            Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town.
            In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit
            into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
          type: string
        sublocality:
          description: |-
            Optional. Sublocality of the address.
            For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts.
          type: string
        addressLines:
          description: |-
            Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address.

            Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may
            sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g.
            "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of
            address lines should be "envelope order" for the country/region of the
            address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is
            used to make it explicit (e.g. "ja" for large-to-small ordering and
            "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of
            an address can be selected based on the language.

            The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists
            of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the
            address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very
            approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be
            made about any of the address components until it was at least
            partially resolved.

            Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and
            then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured
            addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be
            localities or administrative areas).

            For example, it might contain "care of" information.
